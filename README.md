# Project Ideas

This section showcases three web development projects that I plan to build to enhance my skills in full-stack development, utilizing technologies like React.js, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Each project focuses on different aspects of web development, from front-end design to back-end architecture and database management.

## 1. Full-Stack Recipe Sharing Platform

A full-stack web application where users can share their favorite recipes and discover new ones from others. This project will help me dive deeper into React.js for the front end while gaining experience with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for the back end.

### Key Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and sign-up using JWT or OAuth.
- **Recipe Management:** Users can create, edit, delete, and view recipes, including ingredients, instructions, photos, and tags (e.g., vegan, gluten-free).
- **Search and Filter:** Search functionality with filters based on ingredients, tags, or cuisine.
- **Favorites and Comments:** Users can favorite recipes and leave comments.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring a mobile-friendly experience across devices.

### Technologies
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB

## 2. Personal Budget Tracker

An intuitive personal finance management tool designed to help users track their expenses, set budgets, and visualize spending habits over time. This project will allow me to practice building CRUD operations, develop a RESTful API, and incorporate data visualization.

### Key Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login with JWT.
- **Expense Tracking:** Input and categorize expenses with a history view.
- **Budget Setting and Alerts:** Set budgets for different categories and receive alerts for approaching limits.
- **Data Visualization:** Use of Chart.js or D3.js for visualizing spending patterns.
- **Interactive UI:** Built with React.js for a clean and responsive user interface.

### Technologies
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB

## 3. Event Management Web Application

A web application that enables users to create, manage, and RSVP for events. This project will provide practical experience with a full-stack approach, integrating multiple technologies to offer a seamless user experience.

### Key Features
- **User Authentication and Profiles:** Secure authentication with JWT, allowing users to manage their profiles and view events.
- **Event Creation and Management:** Users can create, edit, and manage events, including setting details like date, time, and location.
- **RSVP System:** Interactive RSVP features and notifications for event updates.
- **Calendar Integration and Reminders:** Display events in a calendar format with notifications for upcoming events.
- **Search and Filtering:** Find events by category, location, or date.

### Technologies
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB

## Learning Objectives

- **Full-Stack Development:** Gain proficiency in both front-end and back-end development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
- **API Development:** Learn to build RESTful APIs and manage data effectively between the client and server.
- **Authentication & Security:** Implement secure user authentication using JWT and best security practices.
- **Data Visualization & User Experience:** Develop skills in creating user-friendly interfaces and data visualization tools to enhance user engagement.

Feel free to explore the code and contribute to these projects. I am open to feedback and collaboration as I continue to learn and grow as a developer!

# Web Scraping Bot

This is my plan to build a web scraping bot using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The idea is to scrape data from websites and store it in a database, so later I can use Python to visualize the data or maybe even train a machine learning model. I’m somewhat familiar with Python, but I'll be learning more as I go.

### Getting Started

First, I need to set up my environment. I already know a bit about the MERN stack, so Node.js and Express are a little bit familiar. I’ll use Express to manage the server side of things—it’s lightweight and should be easy to handle. MongoDB will store the scraped data. Since I’m still getting the hang of MongoDB, this will be a good practice to learn how to work with it in a real project.

### Scraping Data

For scraping, I could use a library called `Cheerio` which lets me  grab data from the HTML easily. Some websites might be tricky because they load data with JavaScript, so I’ll use `Puppeteer` for those. Puppeteer lets me control a browser to get the data I need. I’m not familiar with it yet, but I’m excited to learn how it works as I build this bot.

### Storing the Data

Once I’ve scraped the data, I’ll store it in MongoDB. I’ll set up a schema using Mongoose, which will help me define the structure of the data. Since I’m still learning MongoDB, this part will be a bit of an experiment, but I’m confident I’ll figure it out along the way.

### Moving to Python

After collecting a good amount of data, I’ll switch to Python to analyze and visualize it. I’m already familiar with Python, so I’ll use libraries like Pandas for managing the data and if I have to learn Matplotlib to create visualizations i will also do that. If things go well, I might even try training a simple machine learning model with the data. This part should be fun and a great way to deepen my Python skills. Here I would like to train a model to predict football matches outcomes based off the data which I scrape.

This is my plan to build the web scraping bot. I’m learning as I go, so some parts might be challenging, but I’m excited to see what I can create with these tools .
